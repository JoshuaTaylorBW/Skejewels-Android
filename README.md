# Skejewels

The project is a social calendar sharing resource for friends. So think of it as halfway between facebook and a calendar. What that means is that you have a friends list, and all your friends can see your calendar and you can see theirs. Skejewels allow you to keep organized and stay connected to your friends and see what their plans are and what their schedules look like. Its purpose is to enhance and enrich your social life by helping you make plans with your friends and family easier than ever before.
